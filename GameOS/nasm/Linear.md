# linear algebra
    is the branch of mathmatics
        concerning linear equation

# linear equation
    variables: unknowns
        X1, X2, X3, ... Xn
    coefficients: often real numbers
        a1, a2, a3, ... an, b
    a1X1 + a2X2 + a3X3 + ... anXn + b

# linear combination
    is an expression constructed 
        from a set of terms(항, 주기)
         by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results
