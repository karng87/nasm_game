# linear algebra
    is the branch of mathmatics
        concerning linear equation

# linear equation
    variables: unknowns
        X1, X2, X3, ... Xn
    coefficients: often real numbers
        a1, a2, a3, ... an, b
    a1X1 + a2X2 + a3X3 + ... anXn + b

# linear combination
    is an expression constructed 
        from a set of terms(항, 주기)
         by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results


# null space (kernel space)

    1 2 2 4
    0 2 0 4

    x[1 2] y [2 2] z[3 0] w[4 4]
    x + 2y + 2z + 4w
    0x + 2y + 0z + 4w
     -2z + 0w = x
     -2w = y
     z = z
     w = w

    3z = -4w - x -2y

# line integrals
    \int_{c} \vec{F}(\vec{r(t)}) \cdot \vec{dr}
    
    \vec{dr}
        = ( dx, dy, dz )
